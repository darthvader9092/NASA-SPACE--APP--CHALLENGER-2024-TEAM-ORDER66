# EXO-PLANET ODYSSEY 🌍🚀

Welcome to the **EXO-PLANET ODYSSEY** project! This website provides an immersive exploration of Super-Earth exoplanets—planets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. These worlds have long fascinated astronomers because they could potentially harbor life.

The project combines scientific data with an interactive web experience to educate and inspire visitors about these mysterious planets outside our solar system.

## 🌌 Project Overview

The website offers an educational journey into the world of Super-Earth exoplanets. Super-Earths are a type of exoplanet with a mass between Earth and Neptune. They are of particular interest to scientists because of their potential habitability. The site provides an easy-to-understand presentation of key information:

- What is a Super-Earth?
- How are these exoplanets discovered?
- The characteristics of specific Super-Earth exoplanets.
- How Super-Earths compare to our planet in terms of size, orbit, temperature, and potential to support life.

The interactive UI allows users to explore different planets, dive into scientific data, and understand what makes each exoplanet unique.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Interactive Exploration**: The website enables users to interact with visual elements, explore different exoplanets, and view detailed information about each.
- **Dynamic Data**: JavaScript is used to dynamically load exoplanet data, making the site responsive and informative.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and works seamlessly across various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- **Planetary Facts**: Each exoplanet has its own page with detailed facts, such as mass, radius, distance from its star, and potential habitability.
- **Real-Time Animation**: Background animations mimic space travel, giving users the feel of exploring the universe.

### 🔭 Featured Exoplanets

The website showcases some of the most well-known Super-Earths, including:

- **Gliese 667 Cc**: One of the most promising candidates for hosting life, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star.
- **Kepler-22b**: An exoplanet with a radius 2.4 times that of Earth, located in the habitable zone of its star system.
- **Proxima Centauri b**: The closest known exoplanet to Earth, potentially in the habitable zone of its parent star.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project utilizes modern web development technologies to deliver a smooth and engaging user experience:

- **HTML5**: Structured the content and provided the foundation for the website.
- **CSS3**: Styled the website with custom layouts, fonts, colors, and animations to create a space-themed look.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used to add interactivity and dynamic content, including fetching planetary data from APIs.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the website adapts beautifully to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media queries.
  
Additional tools and libraries include:
- **Google Fonts**: For elegant typography and enhanced readability.
- **FontAwesome**: Used for adding visually appealing icons to enhance the user interface.
- **CSS Flexbox & Grid**: Used for structuring layouts and ensuring a responsive design.
